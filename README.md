It contains all my demo/practice apps from basic to intermediate level that I had built during my android development journey. In these apps I have mainly focused on logic building i.e. how to write code in JAVA.

The UI of the apps may not be appealing to the eyes so try ignoring that part :sweat_smile: because as a beginner I have firstly focused on functionality of the app rather than the look of the app.

Here's the list of my projects with their respective APK so feel free to run them on your device-->
