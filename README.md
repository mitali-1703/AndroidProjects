Through this app, I learnt how to add animations to an app and I really loved the way it appears on the screen and would definitely include it in my dream project. Since its my first time working with animations, I have made a single page UI to see how it actually works and it looks decent enough with 3 beautiful animations appearing in the background indeed giving beautiful look to a simple app. The buttons aren't clickable because I don't know how to pop up a login or a signup dailog yet but would soon integrate it as and when I learn it in my further lessons.

## Preview of the app:-
