In this app, I learnt how to import an external library in android studio and how to use <b>Toasty</b> library of Android to have custom toast messages in our app. I tried using all the Toasty methods and really loved those beautiful toasts and would further use them in my upcoming apps too. 

I have made a very basic app consisting of various buttons to have each type of custom toast on the screen.
