In this app, I learnt how I can have rotated animations in my app and also got to revise what I learnt in my previous app i.e. handling different button states and changing its style as per its different states.

I really loved making this app as its one of my favourite game and also the app's UI looks indeed good. The app isn't a complete game app yet but would complete it sooner as I learn more things in android. But till now its just an app with a bottle spinning as and when we hit the SPIN button given.
## Preview of the app:-
