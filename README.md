In this app, I have tried changing the background color of the app (color value ranging from 0 to 255) with a simple button click. This activity was a fun as I loved changing the colors from such a wide variety of range in just a second.

And yes, the UI is really simple so don't focus on that please ðŸ˜….....thank you in advance.
## Preview of the app:-
