Through this app, I learnt how we can design our own custom button, different states of button and changing its colors as and when its state changes and how I can include it in an app. 

Hence, a simple app with a very simple UI having a custom button, which changes its color when clicked and come back to its default color background when released.

## Preview of the app:-
